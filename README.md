# Pong_Game
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
Use "Z" and "S" keys for Player A and Up and Down arrows for player B.
Enjoy :D
